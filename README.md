# SpringBootWithReactStartProject
Recently I start build project with react and spring boot, and I spend hours to fix some bugs with version conflict.
This Use Spring Boot 2.0.1 With React.js.

Here is the original link: https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/
The Blog with in above link provide a way of using react and spring boot together.


This start project is another way of use Spring Boot with React using CrossOrigin.
It separate the FrontEnd and BackEnd.

Steps to run the project:
open the server fold in any IDE run it(Default port:8080)
inside client folder npm start(react side port:3000)
Open localhost:3000 (very simple result just share it for others to start their project)
